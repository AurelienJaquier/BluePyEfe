   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to BluePyEfe's documentation!
=====================================

BluePyEfe aims at easing the process of reading experimental recordings and
extracting batches of electrical features from these recordings. To do so, it
combines
trace reading functions and features extraction functions from the eFel library.

BluePyEfe outputs protocols and features files in the format used by BluePyOpt
for neuron electrical model building.

To get started, we recommend to have a look at the example located in the
github directory of the repository.
